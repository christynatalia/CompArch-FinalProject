# Chat Application Using Socket Programming 

## Short Description: 
This project is an application that allows users to chat and interact with each other by using our server. When the server is turned on, clients are able to send message to all of the online users. Currently, this program is working locally. While making this project, we use Python as the programming language and tkinter for the interface.

## Installation guide: 
1. To install this project, please clone this repository to your local machine.

    clone this repository: https://github.com/christynatalia/CompArch-FinalProject.git


2. Please open at least 3 terminals on your local machine and change the directory into this project.
```bash 
cd CompArch-FinalProject
```

3. On the first terminal, please run the server first 
```bash 
python server.py
```

4. After the server is running, you can run the client on the other terminals. You can run more than one instance of client at one time (maximum number of clients is 5)
```bash 
python client.py
```

5. Type different usernames on the client side and it is working!
